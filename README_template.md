# ZK Developer Program

### Overview
The ZK Developer Program will be an online educational bootcamp designed to cultivate a new generation of contributors across Latin America.

The program will be open to the entire region, focusing on Spanish-speaking participants, providing a highly engaging and personalized learning experience. 

Participation will be open and structured in layers, with student performance evaluated throughout. Only those meeting the established criteria will access the specialization layer, delving into each PSE technology. Additionally, participants showing consistent progress will also have access to office hours with mentors.

As a final layer, the program will encourage contributions to PSE repositories, addressing "first good issues" and collaborating on documentation. All content and classes will remain public and permissionless, following the Ethereum Fellowship Program model.

One goal is to equip participants with foundational cryptography knowledge and open-source development skills. Also, the course equips participants with the skills to integrate advanced cryptographic tools into their projects.

### Short Rationale
After completing the first LATAM edition of the PSE Core Program, which yielded significant contributions, we identified the need for continued education in Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs).

By running the ZK Learning Program, we aim to build on that success, scaling participation across the region, and increasing contributions to the open-source ecosystem.

The primary goal of the ZK Developer Program is to empower developers to use PSE protocols to connect with existing projects or those currently under development.

By fostering hands-on experience with these protocols, we aim to cultivate stronger, well-rounded developer profiles that can contribute to PSE's open-source ecosystem.

Additionally, we seek to provide Spanish-speaking students with high-quality learning resources and access to essential technologies to incorporate advanced cryptographic tools with a focus on data privacy and security.

### Project Details 

Program Content: The platform will offer a comprehensive introduction to Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), focusing initially on ZK-SNARKs and ZK-STARKs. Emphasis will be placed on practical development using Circom with CircomLab, Rust with Halo2, and the Cairo and Noir languages for PSE projects.

Additionally, repositories and Good First Issues will be compiled to promote community contributions. Submissions featuring documentation on how to apply PSE projects in practical contexts will receive additional credit. All sessions will be recorded and held without restrictions to ensure broad accessibility for the entire community.

### Stages of the Program

### Core Components

### Relevant Prior Work
The team members are all graduates of the PSE Core Program, with hands-on experience in privacy technologies and ongoing contributions to PSE projects.

Most of them also were selected for learning grants to continue their work on PSE projects, further deepening their expertise in programmable cryptography technologies and open-source contributions.

Besides that, Alex Padilla and Lucila Pastore served as the program coordinators in Ecuador and Argentina, respectively. Their leadership roles have provided them with valuable insights into what worked, what didn’t, and what needs to be modified or improved for the next editions.

This gives our team a unique value proposition: the combination of having both completed the program and coordinated it gives us a comprehensive understanding of how to optimize the learning experience for this new format.
